# blosxom-feedback
"Feedback" plugin for Blosxom, originally by Frank Hecker (http://hecker.org/blosxom/feedback).

## Changes
This version differs from Frank Hecker's original in several (mostly minor) ways:

* Updated for compatibility with Perl 5.22, see 
  [Issue #1](https://github.com/kadin2048/blosxom-feedback/issues/1).
* Adds support for SMTP Auth and RFC 6409 (use of port 587 for mail submission), 
  see [Issue #3](https://github.com/kadin2048/blosxom-feedback/issues/3).

**Please use Github for questions or to report issues concerning these 
changes.**
